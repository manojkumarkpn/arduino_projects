# Half mode steps calculation
 * Steps  per revolution : 4096sequeces steps : 8
 * Number of steps to be passed for 360 degree:  4096/8 = 512 steps
 * Number of steps to be passed for 180 degree :  4096/8/2 = 256 steps
 * Number of steps to be passed per degree : 360/512 = 0.703125 degree
 * Number of steps to be passed per 10 degree : 10/0.703125 = 14.2222

# Full mode steps calculation
